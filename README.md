# attrib

`attrib` is a performant and lightweight data description library for Python. It provides an intuitive API for describing and validating data structures using Python's descriptor protocol. `attrib` is designed to be familiar and flexible, allowing you to create complex data structures with minimal boilerplate code.

It provides an API similar to `attrs`, but with a focus on performance and simplicity. So far, performance is on par with `attrs`. In most cases, `attrib` is 15 - 35% faster than `attrs`.

`attrib` dataclasses can be used for describing, validating, and serializing data in APIs, configuration definitions, and data processing pipelines.
